@## Counter in filters
[FilterTrigger](/components/filter-trigger/) is normally used together with [Select](/components/select/) or [Dropdown](/components/dropdown/). Go to [the guide](/components/filter-trigger/) for more information.

@example counter-filter

@## Counter in buttons

> Don't forget to place counters inside the buttons in Addon to create correct margins.

@example counter-button

@## Counter in forms

When the limit is reached and exceeded the counter shall change color to orange and red, respectively. This rule is not implemented in the example.

@example counter-textarea

@## Counters and typography

The text counters shall be implemented using [Typography](/style/typography) without using the Counter component.

@## Counters in Pills
