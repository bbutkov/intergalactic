@## Basic venn chart example

In the data, we specify `size`, which is the size of the circle, and `sets`, which is the intersection of the circles.

@example basic-recharts

@## Setting the Venn chart orientation

The chart orientation (rotation) and the order of circles can be changed.

@example orientation-and-order-recharts

@## Data loading
